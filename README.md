## About the App

This demo app will use React.js to render a list of cakes retrieved from a remote server in JSON format.

It includes basic functionality to search, edit existing cakes, and add new ones. - note: there is no cross session data persistence.

The UI is responsive and has been tested in Chrome and Safari on desktop.<br>
Also for mobile devices using Chrome developer tools device emulator (iPad, iPad Pro, Nexus 5, iPhone 5 and iPhone 6).
